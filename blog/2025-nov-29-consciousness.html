                Ok so this relies on thinking about brains as the center of consciousness. And if you’re religious then you might believe that the soul is a separate thing from the human body, but if you don’t believe in that then consciousness is just a result of your brain activity. Like, if you consider people who briefly died and then were resuscitated, a lot of them just say that when you die there isn’t really anything, there’s no memory of anything happening, but they are still conscious of the things that happened to them before and after they died, so I suppose that kind of supports the idea that consciousness is just your brain. Though ofc you can argue against that. But I’m just going to assume it’s true.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And so I was thinking about how the brain changes and how consciousness changes. Like, people had brains when they were embryos and fetuses and infants but nobody can remember anything that happened to them during those times and so in a way they weren’t really conscious or at least not the same consciousness as those people when they become older. At some point though, we are fairly conscious of what’s happening to us and then there is continuity for the rest of our lives. At that point, the brain changes sooo much yet there is still continuity and we are aware of ourselves as being the same person our whole life. Even though from a brain perspective we have completely changed in a lot of ways.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Anyway I guess when we die, if the people who died very briefly are right, there is just nothing because our brains are cooked. But as we decompose, the proteins and molecules and stuff in our brains get decomposed and then repurposed by other organisms and at some point, a bunch of them are going to end up in another creature with a brain. And so I guess I was kind of thinking that in a way, if that creature is also conscious because of their brain, then you are regaining consciousness through them. And I don’t mean that in some metaphorical way, like I feel like you could actually sort of reincarnate into them.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Like, children start with a very minimal amount of brain matter and are not really conscious. Then they eat a bunch of stuff and it adds to their brain and then they gain and sustain their consciousness. Why can’t it go the other way? If my dead brain decays and then gets eaten by a plant and then the plant gets eaten by a child and my dead brain matter transfers into the child and helps grow the child’s brain, am I not now part of that child’s consciousness? Is it not at least slightly conceivable that part of me re-awakens as this child? Obviously there won’t be any continuity in memory or personality with my current life but I feel like it could still be the case that I re-awaken as a consciousness because of this.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Does it matter if only a little bit of my brain is contributing to their brain? I feel like it doesn’t. Because adults’ brains are way way different than their original brains yet they are still the same consciousness. I know brain cells are weird and different than most other cells so idk if this is accurate but intuitively I feel like most of the actual matter in your brain from when you are 5 is probably gone and replaced by the time you’re 20. Yet you’re still the same person, so even a little bit of brain matter is an entire consciousness.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                and then i was also thinking like, if my brain decays, it would probably feed more than just one plant. And if it’s more than just one plant then it would probably feed more than just one creature or person. And if only a little bit of me becomes a reincarnated consciousness in the next person, and a little bit of me is in a bunch of different creatures, then am I not reincarnated into all of them? So I suppose not only am I reincarnated as a person, I’m reincarnated as everything that I became a part of after I die.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                And so if I’m reincarnated consciously as an uncountable number of future creatures, a lot of them probably at the same time, then I feel like every person and creature must be part of the same consciousness? Like everything is constantly reincarnating consciously as everyone and everything else after they die? And even before they die? Like if a bunch of my brain matter is recycled while I’m still living and then goes to feed someone else, am I also a part of that person?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                So idk. I guess I believe in reincarnation? And also that we are all the same person simultanously experiencing everything and intermixing with each other?
