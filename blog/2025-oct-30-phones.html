                Phones
            </h1>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                If one were to carry with them, at all times, a whiskey flask
                to sip from throughout the day; if they could not go a single
                hour without a drink, except, or often in spite of, their most
                deliberate effort; if they drank in every situation and setting,
                whether at home or at work or at a gathering of friends; if one
                acted in this way, then would one not call them an alcoholic?
                Would a good friend of this person not intervene to help break
                their unhealthy relationship with alcohol?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                While alcohol in moderation may not be reason for alarm,
                the consumption of alcohol in this way no doubt brings the
                drinker only harm. What if someone were to act similarly with
                something more ambiguous?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                If one were to bring with them, at all times, their partner;
                if they could not go a single hour without calling or texting
                or otherwise talking to their partner, except, or often in
                spite of, their most deliberate effort; if they brought their
                partner to every situation and setting, whether at home or at
                work or at a gathering of friends; if one acted in this way,
                then would one not say that they are overly-dependent on their
                partner? Would a good friend of this person not intervene to
                help break their unhealthy relationship with their partner?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Or if one were to, at all times, interrupt their task to
                work on tasks for their job; if they could not go a single
                hour without checking their email or discussing a work matter,
                except, or often in spite of, their most deliberate effort; if
                working interrupted or caused them to neglect relaxation at
                home, celebrating special occasions with friends, or attending
                to their family or children; if one acted in this way, then
                would one not say that they are working themselves to death
                and neglecting the other aspects of their life? Would a good
                friend of this person not intervene to help break their
                unhealthy relationship with their work?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                These things in moderation are not sources of alarm,
                and there are some good things that may come out of spending
                a lot of time with a partner or working hard and long hours.
                But in excess, these things bring harm when they cause the rest
                of one's life to be interrupted or neglected. What if someone
                were to act similarly with something that ordinarily brings
                benefit?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                If one were to bring with them, at all times, a thick fur
                coat, then this might be considered normal and fitting for a
                cold winter. A friend might even compliment the coat and say
                it looked stylish.
                But if they continued to wear it in a heated room
                or during the heat of summer; if they began to sweat profusely
                and suffered the symptoms of heat stroke; if they never took
                this coat off, even to wash it, and it began to reek and bear
                the mysterious stains of overuse and a neglectful cleaning
                routine; if one acted in this way, then would one not say
                that they are overly-dependent on their coat? Would a good friend
                of this person not intervene to help break their unhealthy
                relationship with their coat?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                In all of these cases, the use of that which may ordinarily be
                normal or perhaps even beneficial is taken to its extreme and
                it might be called "abuse", or at least "overuse". A friend
                would hope that the person addicted to each of
                these various ordinary things would eventually come to leave
                them behind, though certainly not immediately and likely not in
                entirety. Nevertheless, they would hope for this individual to
                return to a normal level of using these things.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                What if one were to carry with them, at all times, their cell
                phone? What if they could not go a single hour without pulling
                it out to scroll reels or watch videos or text friends, except,
                or often in spite of, their most deliberate effort? What if
                they allowed their phone to interrupt their life in every
                situation and setting, whether at home or at work or at a
                gathering of friends?
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                The ability to instantly connect with the entire world is held
                in the pocket of billions of people. I won't deny that this has
                benefits, but can one not say that alcohol, romantic partners,
                jobs, and winter coats also bring their own benefits?
